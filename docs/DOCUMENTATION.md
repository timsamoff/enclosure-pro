# Enclosure Pro

[![Enclosure Pro Overview](https://img.youtube.com/vi/jDg9bKsPez0/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/jDg9bKsPez0)

## Documentation
Enclosure Pro is pretty straightforward to use and presents very few menu options that should be familiar to any effects pedal builder. Experiment for a few minutes and you'll get the hang of it.

If you have any questions, please email [circuitousfx@gmail.com](mailto:circuitousfx@gmail.com).
